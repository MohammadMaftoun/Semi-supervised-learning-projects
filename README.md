Welcome to the Semi-Supervised Learning Projects Repository, a curated collection of resources and projects leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques. This repository aims to provide a centralized hub for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in exploring semi-supervised learning methodologies. Semi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labeled and unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks.
From transfer learning techniques to community-driven initiatives for dataset creation and labeling, our collection encompasses various methods of semi-supervised learning tailored specifically for GitHub's unique ecosystem. We encourage collaboration, contributions, and the sharing of insights to foster creation and advance the field of machine learning.

# Examples:
    Identifying topics of fraud: In finance, semi-supervised learning can be used to train systems for identifying cases of fraud or shakedown. Rather than hand-labeling thousands of individual instances, engineers can start with a few labeled examples and proceed with one of the semi-supervised learning approaches described above.
    Classifying content on the web: The internet is a large zone, and new websites are put up all the time. To serve valid search results it’s necessary to classify massive amounts of this web content, which can be done with semi-supervised learning.
    Analyzing audio and images: This is conceivably the most popular use of semi-supervised learning. When audio files or image files are developed they’re often not labeled, which makes it challenging to use them for machine learning. Beginning with a small subset of human-labeled data, however, this problem can be overcome.
